# ectddemo

*Note: this README.md is not part of the submission package: delete after read.*

This repo contains a demo eCTD submission package (not R package)
as a companion of the book
[R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission](https://r4csr.org/).

The folder structure only focuses on the part where R is involved thus
greatly simplified compared to a full submission package.

For a demo R package, check [esubdemo](https://github.com/elong0527/esubdemo).
